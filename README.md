# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering princple like method, tools,development and maintainace of high quality software. It's importancey is that it plays a crucial role in the technology industryby enebling the creation of reliable, scaleble and innovative software solution that meet user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.they include
1.The development of program laguages (eg: fortan, C).
2.The establishment of software waterfall model in the 
  1,970s.
3.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2,000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirement: Gathering and documenting user and system requirement.
2. design:reating the architecture and designof the software based on the requirement.
3.Implimentation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing: Conducting various test to ensre the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5,

   


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
