#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry?
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering princple,method, tools,development and maintainace of high quality software. It's importancey is that it plays a crucial role in the technology industryby enebling the creation of reliable, scaleble and innovative software solution that meet user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.they include
1.The development of program laguages (eg: fortan, C).
2.The establishment of software waterfall model in the 
  1,970s.
3.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2,000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. requirement: Gathering and documenting user and system requirement.
2. design:reating the architecture and designof the software based on the requirement.
3.Implimentation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing: Conducting various test to ensre the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.Deployment: Releasing the sftware tothe user or the production environment.
6.Maintanace:Ongoing support and maintainance of the software deployement
7. Evolution: Assessing the success of the project, identifing ares for improvement.
   

    


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies?
Feature	Waterfall	Agile
Approach	Sequential, structured, phase-based	Iterative, flexible, and adaptive
Phases	Defined stages: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance	Continuous cycles (sprints/iterations) of planning, development, testing, and feedback
Flexibility	Low—changes are difficult to accept once a phase is completed	High—adaptable to changes even late in advacement
Documentation regarding and detailed upfront	Lightweight documentation, evolving with project needs
Client Involvement	Limited—client feedback is used at the end	High—frequent feedback from stakeholders
Delivery Time	Delivered at the end of the project	Incremental deliveries throughout the process
Best for	Projects with clear, fixed requirements and low uncertainty	Projects with changing requirements and high uncertainty
Risk Management	Higher risk—problems are often detected late	Lower risk—continuous feedback allows early issue detection
Team Collaboration	Roles are well-defined, and teams work sequentially	Cross-functional teams collaborate closely
When to Use Waterfall
Example Scenarios:

Construction Projects: Building project requires clear planning, defined steps, and fixed timelines.
Medical Device Development: Strict regulatory compliance means extensive documentation and structured phases are needed.
Large Government Contracts: These often require rigid project scopes, extensive documentation, and predictable execution.
When to Use Agile
Example Scenarios:

Software Startups: Rapid iteration is needed to adapt to changing market needs.
Mobile App Development: Continuous updates based on user feedback ensure a better product.
Marketing Campaigns: Adjustments can be made based on audience response and analytics.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. TJhey iclude:
1.Software Development: responsible for writing code and implementing software application.
2.Quality Assurance Engineer: A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software meets the required quality standards before deployment
3.Project Managers: A project manager oversees the planning, executeion, and deliver of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. intergrated Developer Environmennt (IDEs) is a software that provides comprehesive tools for writing, debugging and testing eg: visial studio and eclipees while
2. Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool for tracking changes to source code and codinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. They iclude-
1. Changing Requirements: requirements may  change during the development cycle reading to scope, creep and project delays.
2.Tight Deadlines: presure to deliver software products on schedule can result to rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical Debt: accurued from shortcut or suboptimal solution, technicaldebt can impede future development effort and icrease maintaining cost.
4. Strategies For Overcoming  Challenges: they iclude effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of task,and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1 Unit Testing is defined as the requirements for testing individual componet or fuctions of a software application in isolation.
Goal: Ensures that each unit (eg:, function, method or class)work correctly.
2.Intagration Testing
Defination: test how diffrent unit or components of software interact with each other.
Importance: Identifies issues in data flow betweeen modules.
            Reduce intergration related bugs in later stages
3.System Testing is validation of the whole system to ensure itmeets it requirement.
goal: Test the whole system in a simulated prodution environment.


            


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.it is crafting questions or statements to get possilble responce from AI models. It is importantcy is that it help the machine understand the result you need at eases,and it is also fast if it is given the corret responce. 



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 
example: "write about tecnology"
Clarity – It specifies the exact topic: artificial intelligence in healthcare, rather than just "technology."
Specificity – It outlines key areas to cover: benefits, challenges, and future potential.
Conciseness – The improved version is direct and to the point without unnecessary words.
Defined Scope – It sets a length expectation (500 words), preventing overly broad or too brief responses.
